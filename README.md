## 💻 What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations.

## 🐧 Basic Linux Commands
Here are some Linux commands I learned:
1. ls - List directory contents.
    Example: ls -l (detailed listing)

2. cd - Change directory.
   Example: cd /home/user (navigate to /home/user)

3. pwd - Print working directory.
    Example: pwd (shows current directory)

4. mkdir - Create a new directory.
    Example: mkdir new_folder

5. rmdir - Remove an empty directory.
    Example: rmdir empty_folder

6. touch - Create an empty file.
    Example: touch file.txt

7. cp - Copy files or directories.
    Example: cp source.txt destination.txt

8. mv - Move or rename files or directories.
    Example: mv oldname.txt newname.txt

9. rm - Remove files or directories.
    Example: rm file.txt or rm -r folder

## 🕵️ Version Control with Git
### 📢 Commands
1. `git init`: Initialize a repository.
2. `git add`: Stage changes.

## 🔒 What are Linux File Permissions?

Linux file permissions consist of three sets of permissions:

-User Permissions: Dictate actions the file’s owner can perform.
-Group Permissions: Define permissions for members of the file’s group.
-Other Permissions: Set permissions for all other users on the system.

 🚨 chmod - Change file permissions.

    Example: chmod 755 file.txt

🚨 chown - Change file ownership.

    Example: chown user:group file.txt
